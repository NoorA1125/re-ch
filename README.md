# re-ch
The goal of this exercise is to build an app that fetches data from an external API and displays the data in a grid. There isn't a time limit on this exercise, but we estimate it shouldn't take more than a couple of hours.    Tasks    1.      Create a React App    2.      Use an external API to get data and images, we use GraphQL internally for most of our API calls so extra credit if you use the GraphQL endpoint.   a.      https://api.spacex.land/graphql/   b.      https://api.spacex.land/rest/   3.      With the data returned render out a responsive grid of cards.  The grid should start off with multiple columns and then go down to 1 column on mobile.   The card should have an image/video as well as some meaningful text below.
